# Plume workshop homework

This is a jupyter notebook for the homework for the MEMO2 plume workshop in Heidelberg, 8-10 October 2018.

The exercise is based on an acetylene tracer release experiment conducted by LSCE in 2015. The acetylene plume was intercepted multiple times by mobile measurements from a car along a street perpendicular to the main plume axis.

In this exercise, the students learn to evaluate the measurements and to estimate the source strength by fitting a Gaussian plume model to the observations.
